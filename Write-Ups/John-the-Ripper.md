# üé© Introducing John the Ripper (Jumbo John): A Powerful Password Cracking Tool

In the realm of cybersecurity and ethical hacking, password cracking is a critical skill for testing system defenses and recovering lost credentials. Among the many tools available, **John the Ripper (JtR)** stands out as one of the most versatile and widely-used password cracking utilities.

Originally developed for Unix-based systems, John the Ripper has evolved to support a wide range of platforms and hash types, making it a go-to tool for penetration testers and security professionals.

Today, we'll go through the practical use of John the Ripper - Jumbo John across several real-world scenarios, including:

- [Basic installation](https://github.com/Dee-Techie/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/Write-Ups/John-the-Ripper.md#-installation-guide) (covered in this article below)

# üîì Cracking Hashes with John the Ripper

## üß∞ Basic Syntax

```bash
john [options] [file path]
```

| Component   | Description                                                  |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `john`      | Invokes John the Ripper                                      |
| `[options]` | Various flags to specify behavior                            |
| `[file]`    | File containing hashes (no path needed if in same directory) |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Automatic Cracking

Use this if you‚Äôre unsure about the hash format:

```bash
john --wordlist=[path to wordlist] [path to file]
```

üìå **Example:**
```bash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash_to_crack.txt
```

| Option         | Description                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| `--wordlist=`  | Enables dictionary attack mode       |
| `rockyou.txt`  | Common password list used for attack |

---

## üîç Identifying Hash Types

Sometimes John can't automatically detect the hash format. You can identify it using:

### üîß Tool: `hash-identifier`

1. Download:
   ```bash
   wget https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/packages/hash-identifier/-/raw/kali/master/hash-id.py
   ```
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python3 hash-id.py
   ```

üéØ This tool will return possible hash types like:
```
[+] MD5
[+] Domain Cached Credentials - MD4(MD4(($pass)).(strtolower($username)))
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e1f09b0-1cbe-4ef1-bfd2-5e6a4750462a)

---

## üéØ Format-Specific Cracking

Once the hash format is identified, use:

```bash
john --format=[format] --wordlist=[path] [hash_file]
```

üìå **Example:**
```bash
john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash_to_crack.txt
```

| Option         | Description                                              |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `--format=`    | Specifies exact hash type                                |
| `raw-md5`      | Format identifier for raw MD5 hashes                     |
| `rockyou.txt`  | Password list used for the dictionary attack             |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Prefix common hash types with `raw-` (e.g., `raw-md5`, `raw-sha1`).  
> Use `john --list=formats` to view all supported formats.

```bash
john --list=formats | grep -iF "md5"
```

## üîê Cracking Windows Authentication Hashes

### üß† What Are Authentication Hashes?
Authentication hashes are encrypted representations of user passwords stored by operating systems like Windows. These hashes can sometimes be **cracked via brute-force** or dictionary attacks using tools like **John the Ripper**, but usually require **privileged access** to obtain first.

### üíæ NTHash / NTLM Overview

| Feature              | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **NTHash / NTLM**    | Modern Windows password hashing format (often called NTLM)                  |
| **Legacy**           | Preceded by **LM (LAN Manager)**; both terms often appear together as NT/LM |
| **Location**         | Stored in Windows' **SAM** database or **NTDS.dit** for Active Directory     |
| **Tools to Extract** | Tools like **Mimikatz**, **samdump2**, or accessing Active Directory         |

### üè∑Ô∏è A Bit of History
The **NT** in NTHash originally stood for **"New Technology"**, a branding for Windows products that didn't rely on MS-DOS. Though the "NT" naming has since been retired, it still exists in technologies like NTLM.

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Use
Once NTLM hashes are acquired, you can:
- ‚úÖ **Crack** them with John the Ripper (especially if weak passwords are used).
- üîÅ **Pass the hash** to authenticate without cracking (commonly used in lateral movement or privilege escalation).
