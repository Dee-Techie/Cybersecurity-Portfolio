# 🛡️ Threat Modelling & 🚨 Incident Response

## 🧠 What is Threat Modelling?
Threat modelling is the **proactive process** of analyzing, improving, and testing the security of an organization’s IT infrastructure. It's about identifying **what could go wrong** before it does.

Similar to a workplace risk assessment, it includes:

- 📝 Preparation
- 🔍 Identification
- 🛠️ Mitigations
- 🔄 Review

Effective threat modelling incorporates:
- 📡 Threat Intelligence
- 🧾 Asset Identification
- 🛡️ Mitigation Capabilities
- ⚖️ Risk Assessment

## ⚙️ STRIDE Framework

STRIDE is a classic threat modelling framework created by Microsoft that helps classify threats into six categories:

| Principle              | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Spoofing**           | Faking identity to gain unauthorized access. Use authentication methods like API keys or encryption. 🔑 |
| **Tampering**          | Modifying data without authorization. Implement integrity checks to detect changes. 🛠️ |
| **Repudiation**        | Denying actions or access. Use logging and auditing to track activities. 🧾 |
| **Information Disclosure** | Leaking sensitive information to unauthorized parties. Ensure access controls and data classification. 🔐 |
| **Denial of Service**  | Exhausting system resources to make services unavailable. Implement rate limiting and redundancy. 🚫 |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Gaining higher-level access like admin. Enforce least privilege and monitor access controls. ⬆️ |

## 🔥 Incident Response (IR)

Despite your best defenses, **incidents happen**. IR is the process of handling and recovering from cybersecurity breaches.

### 🎯 Goals of IR:
- Minimize damage
- Recover quickly
- Prevent recurrence

Incidents are managed by a **CSIRT** (Computer Security Incident Response Team) and are measured by:
- ⚡ **Urgency** (type of attack)
- 🧨 **Impact** (business disruption)

### 🛠️ Six Phases of Incident Response:

| Action         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Preparation**   | Are you ready? Plans, people, and tools in place. 🧰 |
| **Identification**| Is it really an incident? Analyze the threat. 🔍 |
| **Containment**   | Limit the scope and spread. 🚧 |
| **Eradication**   | Remove the root of the problem. 🧹 |
| **Recovery**      | Restore systems and resume normal operations. 🔁 |
| **Lessons Learned** | What went wrong and how can we prevent it next time? 🧠 |
