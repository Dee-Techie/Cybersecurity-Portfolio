# 🛡️ Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Summary

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) refers to **evidence-based knowledge** about cyber adversaries, including their tactics, motivations, indicators, and suggested defensive actions. It empowers cybersecurity teams and business leaders to make informed decisions and proactively defend critical assets.

## 🎯 CTI Goals

- Understand the adversary targeting your environment.
- Build a contextual defense strategy by answering:
  - Who is attacking you?
  - What are their motivations and capabilities?
  - What indicators of compromise (IOCs) should you watch for?

## 📊 Threat Intelligence Classifications

1. **Strategic Intelligence** 🧠  
   High-level trends and risks that impact business decisions and long-term planning.

2. **Technical Intelligence** 💾  
   Indicators and artefacts (malware, logs, etc.) useful for incident response and defense.

3. **Tactical Intelligence** ⚔️  
   Focuses on adversaries' Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).

4. **Operational Intelligence** 🕵️‍♂️  
   Insights into adversary intent, motives, and targeted critical assets (people, processes, technologies).

## 🔁 CTI Lifecycle

1. **Direction** ➡️  
   Define goals, assets to protect, threats, data sources, and required tools.

2. **Collection** 📥  
   Gather threat data from commercial, open-source, and internal sources.

3. **Processing** ⚙️  
   Parse and structure raw data using tools like SIEMs for usability.

4. **Analysis** 🔍  
   Derive insights, investigate IOCs, plan mitigation, and justify resource needs.

5. **Dissemination** 📤  
   Share intelligence with stakeholders in tailored formats (exec summary vs. technical reports).

6. **Feedback** 🔄  
   Incorporate stakeholder feedback to refine CTI processes.

## 🧩 Common CTI Frameworks

1. **MITRE ATT&CK** 🔬  
   A globally accessible matrix of adversary behaviors categorized by Tactics and Techniques. It helps map attacker activities and improve detection and response.

2. **Diamond Model** 💎  
   A threat analysis framework visualizing four core features of an intrusion: Adversary, Capability, Infrastructure, and Victim. Useful for understanding attacker relationships and activity patterns.

3. **Cyber Kill Chain (by Lockheed Martin)** 🔗  
   A model outlining 7 stages of an attack (e.g., Reconnaissance → Actions on Objectives). Helps defenders identify and disrupt attacks at early phases.

4. **STIX (Structured Threat Information eXpression)** 🧱  
   A standardized language to represent threat intelligence (IOCs, TTPs, etc.) in a structured, machine-readable format.

5. **TAXII (Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information)** 🔄  
   A protocol for automated sharing of STIX data between trusted partners and tools, supporting collaboration and real-time intelligence exchange.
