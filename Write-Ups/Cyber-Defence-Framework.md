# 🛡️ Welcome to Cyber Defence Frameworks!

## Hey there, cyber explorers! 👋  
This blog is all about the awesome frameworks that help blue teamers (like you and I) understand how attackers think — and how we can stop them in their tracks. 🚫🎯

#### These frameworks aren't just theory — they're our cheat codes towards understanding, spotting, and outsmarting real-world threats. 🎮🔍
