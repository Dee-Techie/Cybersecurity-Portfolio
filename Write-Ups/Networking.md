# 💻🔗💻 Networking

Ever wondered how hackers sniff traffic or how firewalls know what to block? 🤔  
Welcome to my **Networking Essentials** zone — not your average textbook regurgitation, but a hands-on, security-first approach to understanding how data actually moves across networks.  

This is where I break down complex networking topics into fun, practical, and cybersecurity-relevant chunks — perfect if you're aiming for a SOC role, prepping for a cert, or just tired of Googling "what port does DNS use" every week. 😅

Let’s deconstruct the web one packet at a time! 🧵🔍
