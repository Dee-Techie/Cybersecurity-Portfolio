# 🛠️ Exploitation

Welcome to the Exploitation zone — where things start to get *real*. This section is all about understanding how vulnerabilities are abused, how exploits are built or launched, and what tools help make that happen.

Whether you're aiming to understand how attackers gain initial access or you're sharpening your skills as a blue team defender, this is where theory meets action.

We'll start with the basics — like **Moniker Links** and how they can be weaponized in Microsoft Outlook — then jump into **Metasploit**, the go-to framework for penetration testing and payload delivery. You’ll also find a section on **Blue**, Microsoft's exploit development tool, useful for fuzzing and crafting custom exploits.
