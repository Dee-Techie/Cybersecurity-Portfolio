# 🔐 Securing the Internet: From Plaintext to Encrypted Protocols

Welcome to the next part of my cybersecurity learning journey! In this writeup, we’re diving into how **SSL/TLS** (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security) transforms everyday, plaintext protocols into secure communication channels. 🌍💬

The internet wasn’t built with security in mind — protocols like **HTTP**, **SMTP**, **POP3**, **IMAP**, and **Telnet** originally sent data in **plaintext**, meaning anyone sniffing the traffic could read your credentials, emails, or private data. 😱 Not ideal, right?

That’s where **TLS** comes in — it wraps these existing protocols with **encryption**, **integrity checks**, and **authentication**, giving rise to:

- 🛡 **HTTPS** – [Secure Web Browsing]()
- 📤 **SMTPS** – [Secure Mail Sending]()
- 📬 **POP3S** – [Secure Mail Retrieval]()
- 📧 **IMAPS** – [Secure Mail Retrieval]()
- 💻 **SSH** –[Secure Remote Access Replacing Telnet]()
- 🌍 **VPNs** – [Secure Tunnels over Insecure Networks]()

We’ll break down each protocol, show real examples, and explain the key benefits TLS brings to the table. 🔒🚀
