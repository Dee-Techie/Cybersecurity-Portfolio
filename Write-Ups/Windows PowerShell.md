# üèé Windows PowerShell

PowerShell is a powerful tool designed for task automation and configuration management. It combines a command-line interface and a scripting language built on the .NET framework. Unlike older text-based command-line tools, PowerShell is object-oriented, which means it can handle complex data types and interact with system components more effectively. Its designed to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## üåãThe Power in PowerShell
To fully grasp the power of PowerShell, we first need to understand what an object is in this context.

In programming, an object represents an item with properties (characteristics) and methods (actions). For example, a car object might have properties like Color, Model, and FuelLevel, and methods like Drive(), HonkHorn(), and Refuel().

Similarly, in PowerShell, objects are fundamental units that encapsulate data and functionality, making it easier to manage and manipulate information. An object in PowerShell can contain file names, usernames or sizes as data (properties), and carry functions (methods) such as copying a file or stopping a process.

The traditional Command Shell‚Äôs basic commands are text-based, meaning they process and output data as plain text. Instead, when a cmdlet (pronounced command-let) is run in PowerShell, it returns objects that retain their properties and methods. This allows for more powerful and flexible data manipulation since these objects do not require additional parsing of text.
