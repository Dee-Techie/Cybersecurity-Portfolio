# #Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction to Hashing

Imagine you just downloaded a **6 GB file** and want to verify it's exactly the same as the original‚Äî**bit for bit**. Or perhaps someone gave you the file on a USB drive. How can you be confident the file hasn't been tampered with or corrupted?

## The Answer: Hash Values

You can verify the file‚Äôs integrity by **comparing hash values**. If the hash value of your file matches the original, you can be almost certain the files are identical.

## What is a Hash Value?

A **hash value** is a **fixed-size string** of characters generated by a **hash function**.  
- The **hash function** takes input of any size (small or large).
- It returns a **fixed-length output** (the hash value), regardless of input size.

This makes it a powerful tool for:
- Verifying file integrity
- Detecting changes
- Ensuring data consistency
- And much more (explored in later sections)

## A Note on Terminology

In this context, you‚Äôll encounter the following terms:
- **Hash function**: The algorithm that computes the hash value.
- **Hash value**: The output string resulting from a hash function.
- **Hash (verb)**: To compute a hash value (e.g., "hash the file").
- **Hash (noun)**: Often used to refer to the hash value itself.

Understanding hashes is essential for ensuring data integrity and detecting tampering in cybersecurity.
