# üõ°Ô∏è Phishing Prevention and Email Security

## üì¨ Defender Actions

There are various actions a defender can take to help protect users from falling victim to a malicious email. Here are some key preventive measures:

- ‚úÖ **Email Security** (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
- üß± **SPAM Filters** ‚Äì Flags or blocks incoming emails based on reputation
- üè∑Ô∏è **Email Labels** ‚Äì Alerts users that an incoming email is from an outside source
- üö´ **Email Address/Domain/URL Blocking** ‚Äì Based on reputation or explicit denylist
- üìé **Attachment Blocking** ‚Äì Based on the extension of the attachment
- üß™ **Attachment Sandboxing** ‚Äì Detonates email attachments in a sandbox environment to detect malicious activity
- üß† **Security Awareness Training** ‚Äì Conduct internal phishing campaigns

### ‚ùì What is SPF?

According to [dmarcian](https://dmarcian.com/spf-survey/):

> "Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is used to authenticate the sender of an email. With an SPF record in place, Internet Service Providers can verify that a mail server is authorized to send email for a specific domain."

An SPF record is a **DNS TXT record** that lists the IP addresses authorized to send email for your domain.

- `ip4:127.0.0.1` ‚Üí Authorized sender IP (IPv4)
- `include:_spf.google.com` ‚Üí Authorized sender domain
- `-all` ‚Üí Reject all non-authorized senders

### üß™ Real-World SPF Record Example

Using dmarcian‚Äôs **SPF Surveyor Tool**, you can inspect domains like Twitter‚Äôs SPF setup.

### üîç SPF Check via Google Admin Toolbox

Using **Google Admin Toolbox Messageheader**, we can check SPF validation status for emails.

Example result:
> SPF Status: `softfail`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note:
Though this example uses **dmarcian**, there are many other tools and providers available for SPF checking and validation.
