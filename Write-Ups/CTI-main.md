# 🧠 Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is all about **knowing your enemy** — who’s targeting you, why, how, and what you can do about it. CTI gives cybersecurity teams the context and insights they need to prevent, detect, and respond to threats faster and smarter. ⚔️🕵️‍♀️

Whether you’re in SOC operations, red teaming, or just threat hunting on a Friday night (hello, overtimers 👋), CTI brings value to every layer of security.

## 🔄 CTI Lifecycle

Effective [CTI](https://github.com/Dee-Techie/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/Write-Ups/CTI.md) isn’t just about collecting data — it’s about turning raw intel into **actionable insights** that drive smart decisions. Here's how the CTI lifecycle works:

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🎯 [**Direction**](https://github.com/Dee-Techie/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/Write-Ups/CTI.md) | Define goals, threat priorities, critical assets, and questions to be answered. |
| 📦 [**Collection**](https://github.com/Dee-Techie/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/Write-Ups/CTI.md) | Gather data from open-source intel, commercial feeds, internal logs, honeypots, and sensors. |
| 🧹 [**Processing**](https://github.com/Dee-Techie/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/Write-Ups/CTI.md) | Normalize and format raw data (e.g., logs, malware hashes, alerts) into usable intel. |
| 🔍 [**Analysis**](https://github.com/Dee-Techie/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/Write-Ups/CTI.md) | Correlate indicators, uncover attacker patterns, and turn data into insights. |
| 📤 [**Dissemination**](https://github.com/Dee-Techie/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/Write-Ups/CTI.md) | Share findings with relevant teams — execs get trends, analysts get IOCs and TTPs. |
| 🔁 [**Feedback**](https://github.com/Dee-Techie/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/Write-Ups/CTI.md) | Refine intel based on what worked, what didn’t, and what’s needed next. |

## 🔍 Practical CTI in Action

Here’s how threat analysts use open-source tools in real-world investigations:

| 🛠️ Tool | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| 🌐 **UrlScan.io** | Scan and analyze suspicious URLs for redirection, malware, or phishing content. |
| 💣 **Abuse.ch** | Track botnets, ransomware families, and known malware indicators (e.g., IOCs, hashes). |
| 📬 **PhishTool** | Investigate suspicious emails and identify phishing attempts using advanced analysis. |
| 🔎 **Cisco Talos** | Perform deep threat research using one of the most comprehensive intel platforms. |
