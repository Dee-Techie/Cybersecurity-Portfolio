#ðŸ§µ Data Delivery & Communication Protocols

The IP protocol allows us to reach a destination host on the network; the host is identified by its IP address. We need protocols that would enable processes on networked hosts to communicate with each other. There are two transport protocols to achieve that: UDP and TCP (both operate at Layer 4 - ISO OSI Model).

Both UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) are transport layer protocols used for data transmission:

> - UDP: Provides fast but unreliable communication. It is commonly used for real-time applications like video streaming.
> - TCP: Ensures reliable and ordered communication, using acknowledgments and retransmissions if errors occur.
