# 🧪 Cybersecurity Labs (WIP 🚧🚧🚧)

This folder contains hands-on labs I've completed to build practical cybersecurity skills.

## 🔬 Cyber Threat Intelligence Labs

### 👩‍⚖️ [Friday Overtime - CTI Lab](https://github.com/Dee-Techie/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/Labs/CTI-lab.md)
📅 **Date:** June 2025  
🧠 **Skills:** CTI, OSINT, Malware Analysis, MITRE ATT&CK, CyberChef, IOC Hunting  
🧰 **Tools:** Terminal, VirusTotal, CyberChef, MITRE, DocIntel, Google  
📄 **Summary:**  
As the lone CTI Analyst on a Friday night, I was tasked with investigating malware targeting a financial firm. I analyzed real-world artefacts, extracted IOCs, and mapped them to relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques — all while racing against the clock.

### 🕵️‍♂️ [Trooper - APT Threat Attribution Lab](https://github.com/Dee-Techie/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/Labs/Trooper.md)
📅 **Date:** June 2025  
🧠 **Skills:** CTI, OSINT, Threat Attribution, MITRE ATT&CK Mapping, Intelligence Correlation  
🧰 **Tools:** OpenCTI, MITRE Navigator, VirusTotal, OSINT  
📄 **Summary:**  
Analyzed a real-world threat campaign by Tropic Trooper (APT X) using USBferry malware against air-gapped networks. Identified phishing tactics, STIX-based IOCs, tools, and mapped TTPs to MITRE ATT&CK using OpenCTI and Navigator to build a threat profile and perform behavior-based attribution.
