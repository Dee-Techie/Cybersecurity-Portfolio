# 🧪 Cybersecurity Labs (WIP 🚧🚧🚧)

This folder contains hands-on labs I've completed to build practical cybersecurity skills.

## 🔬 Cyber Threat Intelligence Labs

### 👩‍⚖️ [Friday Overtime - CTI Lab](https://github.com/Dee-Techie/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/Labs/CTI-lab.md)
📅 **Date:** June 2025  
🧠 **Skills:** CTI, OSINT, Malware Analysis, MITRE ATT&CK, CyberChef, IOC Hunting  
🧰 **Tools:** Terminal, VirusTotal, CyberChef, MITRE, DocIntel, Google  
📄 **Summary:**  
As the lone CTI Analyst on a Friday night, I was tasked with investigating malware targeting a financial firm. I analyzed real-world artefacts, extracted IOCs, and mapped them to relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques — all while racing against the clock.

### 🕵️‍♂️ [Trooper - APT Threat Attribution Lab](https://github.com/Dee-Techie/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/Labs/Trooper.md)
📅 **Date:** June 2025  
🧠 **Skills:** CTI, OSINT, Threat Attribution, MITRE ATT&CK Mapping, Intelligence Correlation  
🧰 **Tools:** OpenCTI, MITRE Navigator, VirusTotal, OSINT  
📄 **Summary:**  
Analyzed a real-world threat campaign by Tropic Trooper (APT X) using USBferry malware against air-gapped networks. Identified phishing tactics, STIX-based IOCs, tools, and mapped TTPs to MITRE ATT&CK using OpenCTI and Navigator to build a threat profile and perform behavior-based attribution.

## 📧 Phishing Email Analysis Lab 

### 👨‍💻 [Snapped Phish-ing Line – Email Analysis Exercise](https://github.com/Dee-Techie/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/Labs/Phishing-Email-Analysis-1.md)
📅 **Date:** June 2025  
🧠 **Skills:** Email Header Analysis, URL Inspection, OSINT, Threat Hunting, Security Awareness  
🧰 **Tools:** PhishTool, VirusTotal, CyberChef 
📄 **Summary:**  
As a Level 1 SOC Analyst, I was tasked with analyzing multiple suspicious emails reported by coworkers. This lab involved extracting data from email headers and bodies, identifying spoofed addresses, shortened URLs, and determining the origin IPs and suspicious domains. The objective was to gather actionable intelligence to help the team proactively prevent similar phishing attempts in the future.

### 👨‍💻 [Snapped Phish-ing Line (Case 2) – Attachment Investigation](https://github.com/Dee-Techie/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/Labs/Phishing-Email-Analysis-2.md)  
📅 **Date:** June 2025  
🧠 **Skills:** Malware Analysis, Threat Intelligence, Email Security, IOC Extraction  
🧰 **Tools:** Any.Run, VirusTotal, CyberChef  
📄 **Summary:**  
As part of an ongoing phishing investigation, I analyzed a suspicious email attachment that had been flagged in a previous exercise. This lab involved inspecting the behavior of a malicious PDF file in a dynamic malware analysis sandbox (Any.Run). My goal was to extract IOCs such as file hashes, IP addresses, and suspicious processes to support phishing rule implementation.

## 🔬 Network Traffic Analysis Labs 
### ✉️ [SMTP Packet Dive - Wireshark Lab](https://github.com/Dee-Techie/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/blob/main/Labs/Wireshark-SMTP-Traffic.md) 
📅 **Date:** June 2025  
🧠 **Skills:** SMTP Protocol Analysis, Email Forensics, Packet Inspection  
🧰 **Tools:** Wireshark  
📄 **Summary:**  
In this lab, I examined captured SMTP traffic using Wireshark to understand how email communications flow at the protocol level. I filtered SMTP responses, identified status codes like `220` and `553`, and reviewed blocked messages flagged by spamhaus.org. The lab helped me recognize malicious attachments and analyze SMTP commands in depth — one packet at a time.
